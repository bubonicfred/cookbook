Place the following in a food processor and blend until smooth: @nutritional yeast{3%cups},  @kosher salt{5%tbsp}, @dried onion{3%tbsp} [- flakes or powder not onion salt -], @dried parsley{3%tbsp}, @dried sage{2.5%tsp}, @celery seed{2.5%tsp}, @garlic powder{2.5%tsp}, @dried thyme{2.5%tsp}, @dried marjoram{2.5%tsp}, @dried rosemary{2.5%tsp}, @paprika{2.5%tsp}, @dried basil{1%tsp}
Store in a sealed jar in the refrigerater.
Use 1 tbsp to 1 cup of boiling water.
-- I premake a large batch without the yeast, and make smaller batches by adding the yeast. My ratio is 14 grams of herb mix to 1/3 cup nutr. yeast, YMMV
